### About
This project is meant to provide a simple keyboard-only virtual MIDI controller.

You can easily explore chord changes and melodies, learning about diatonic chords, secondary dominants, modal interchange, and more.

It is a **work in progress**, the current version runs exclusively on a terminal and lacks any visualizations besides colored text.
