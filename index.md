### About
This project is meant to provide a simple keyboard-only virtual MIDI controller.

You can easily explore chord changes and melodies, learning about diatonic chords, secondary dominants, modal interchange, and more.

It is a **work in progress**, the current version runs exclusively on a terminal and lacks any visualizations besides colored text.

### DAWs
A music recording program (DAW) is needed to provide the virtual instruments you will play using lithium-cli.

Some examples are: GarageBand (MacOS), LMMS (Linux), Ableton Live (multi-platform).
