### About this project

### Downloads
- MacOS [download](https://github.com/mauriciocarbajal/lithium-cli/releases/download/v0.1.1/lithium-cli-0.1.1-macos.zip)

Remember that you also need to open a music recording program that provides the virtual instruments, such as: GarageBand (MacOS), LMMS (Linux), Ableton Live (multi-platform), etc. Once you run lithium-cli, your recording program will detect a new input source.

After downloading the zip file just extract it, and run the binary file in your terminal.
